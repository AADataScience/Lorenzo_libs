# Lorenzo_libs
Libraries I wrote to help keep my scripts as short as possible.

1) my_library.py  : contains general objects (connecting to SQL, write and read files from excell, etc)
2) my_stat_library : contains statistical and machine learning object (regressions, clustering, classification, etc.)
